# Wander App

## Why Wander?

> Traveling within the same country or to a foreign country for the
> first time can be extremely challenging; where to go, how to get
> there, what to eat, hot places to visit of historical significance or

> This guide app looks to solve all this by connecting users to
> dedicated professionals, screened and trained guide for every trip.
> Users can choose a guide based on their ratings and expertise of all
> available professionally profiled local guides at any given
> destination. Best places to visit are curated for the pleasure of the
> tourists. Ratings and comments for places visited, guides after each
> trip is used to improve our service . Guides can also rate users after trips.
> So whether you're traveling to your home state within the US or to
> another state or to the Middle East or Africa; you should wear the
> same confidence!
